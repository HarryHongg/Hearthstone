# Hearthstone
A simple Defile solver   
The main program simulates a possible board of Hearthstone and allow my minions to attack enemy minions.   
The simulation is designed for test defile solver and it does not generate minions with ability like taunt.
Solver gives a solution to current board so that the effect of Defile is maximized.
